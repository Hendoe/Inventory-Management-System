Inventory Management System is a Full-Stack Application made to be as modular and and customizable as possible. It's essentially a template that can be refined to suit the needs of clients. Everything from Coffee Shops, Junk Yards, personal belongings, digital retailers, etc. This version will include a few mock templates or allow a User to create a System from the ground up.

Right now it uses a Menu Inventory. It lets a User punch in items to the menu and retrieve them randomly.

Next will be to create an HTML form that is populated by these functions, followed up an interface to allow a User to do this manually, instead of having to code it all into JS.

After that, I have to make some template objects. For food, cars, supplies... things like name, quantity, vin, price, size, whatever the case may be.
